# Storing information in Database using Node Red and Firebase.  

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed during its runtime in a single-click.  

## Browser-based flow editing.  
Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed during runtime in a single-click. JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using a rich text editor. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.

We use firebase for database creation.  

## The steps are as follows:  

**Step 1**: Create an account in firebase and choose a name for your project, choose the country too.  

**Step 2**: On the console of Firebase, go to Authentication and enable email verification.  

**Step 3**: From the database option copy the weblink for your database.  

**Step 4**: Change the view of the database so that it becomes public.  

**Step 5**: Now add data and variables by clicking on the ‘+’ sign adjacent to the project name.  

**Step 6**: Go to Node Red, in the **manage palette** -> search for **firebase** -> install **node-red-contrib-firebase**.  

**Step 7**: From the nodes installed, select firebase **modify node**, also add an **inject node**.  

**Step 8**: Set up firebase node by entering the link copied earlier and setting the authentication type as **null**.  

**Step 9**: Mention the child path, that is, the name of any of the variables created. Connect both nodes and press deploy.  

**Step 10**: To create a new variable every time, select **push** option.  

**Step 11**: For the circuit we need, the configuration is shown below. For the gpio ports, the pins to be set for output or input are chosen.

**Step 12**: Now the circuit is placed on the breadboard.

Every detection by the *PIR Sensor* now produces a record in the database. The database can be viewed anywhere using the database link previously found.
